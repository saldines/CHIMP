# CHIMP
aka CHIMP is a compilation of seismic intensity observations from moderate to large earthquakes over the past 162 years in California.

The ‘repository’ contains full felt reports and MMI assignments for earthquakes that were reinterpreted for this study.

The ‘dataset’ contains numeric data files formatted as LON, LAT, MMI (Modified Mercalli Intensity scale). Historic earthquakes in the ‘dataset’ are .csv files, Did You Feel It? (DYFI) earthquakes in the ‘dataset’ are .txt files in their original format from the USGS.

The dataset also contains a file of maximum observed intensities (CHIMP1_MAX) in a 10 x 10-km grid over California.
