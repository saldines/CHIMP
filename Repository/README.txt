The repository contains documents for each of the earthquakes in which intensities were reinterpreted by CHIMP authors. Earthquakes with previously published intensity reassignments or DYFI data are not included.

In each file, the columns are the following
City (of observation)
State (of observation)
Latitude (of observation)
Longitude (of observation)
Info source - where the intensity report was collected from
Source of lat/lon - the source where authors obtained lat/lon coordinates based on the location given by the intensity report
Description - the intensity report
Report MMI - original MMI/intensity determined by report prior to reassignment, if applicable
I_initials (2 - 3 columns) - reinterpreted MMI by CHIMP authors 
I_mean - averaged MMI reinterpretation
